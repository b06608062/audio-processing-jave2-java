## Library we used

### JAVE2
We use `JAVE2`, Java Audio Video Encoder 2, for our project. `JAVE2` is [open-sourced on GitHub](https://github.com/a-schild/jave2).
This library is actually a `ffmpeg` wrapper for Java. Both a simple way and an advanced way to manipulate `ffmpeg` is provided by `JAVE2`, which we will demonstrate in later paragraphs.
